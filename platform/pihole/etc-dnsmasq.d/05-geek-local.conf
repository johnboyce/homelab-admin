# Homelab internal DNS — all *.geek domains → geek host (nginx reverse proxy)
# Managed by Ansible (ansible/roles/pihole/tasks/main.yml).
#
# Uses dnsmasq address= directive (NOT Pi-hole custom.list) to avoid Pi-hole v6
# db/list sync issues where custom.list edits are silently ignored by FTL.
#
# Wildcard matches: geek, auth.geek, plane.geek, forgejo.geek, woodpecker.geek,
#                   bookstack.geek, pihole.geek, and any future *.geek services.
