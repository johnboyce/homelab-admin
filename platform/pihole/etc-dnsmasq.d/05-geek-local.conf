# Homelab internal DNS — wildcard fallback for *.geek → geek host (nginx)
# Managed by Ansible (ansible/roles/pihole/tasks/main.yml).
#
# NOTE: Pi-hole v6 has misc.etc_dnsmasq_d = false by default, so this file
# is NOT read by FTL unless that setting is enabled in pihole.toml.
# Primary DNS resolution uses /etc/pihole/hosts/05-geek-local.list instead.
#
# To activate this wildcard, set in pihole.toml:
#   [misc]
#   etc_dnsmasq_d = true
# Then new *.geek services would resolve without updating the hosts list.
